# Work Day Scheduler
challenge #5 - work day scheduler (daily planner)

## Task
- Create a daily planner that can save tasks that I enter via text
- Build a visual so that it is apparent whether it is past, present, or future
- Save blocks into local storage so that they can be recalled and persist

## Process
- Define important variables that correspond to html elements
- Build functions that save text, display color theme (past, present, future), display time
- Save and recall items so that they persist using local storage

## What I learned
- How to traverse the DOM using loops and jQuery syntax
- Reinforced knowledge of languages and libraries, especially jQuery
- How to use dayjs, and display it in different formats
